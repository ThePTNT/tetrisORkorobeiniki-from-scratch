# tetrisORkorobeiniki-from-scratch
I made the tetris song/korobeiniki from scratch in Bosca Ceoil with only triangle and saw wave (Also with all BPM variants from 120 BPM to 220 BPM). Feel free to download and listen to, just make sure to give credit to ThePTNT if you are using it in one of your projects. Thanks!
Just download one of the song files, which will be titled numberofbeatsperminute.wav, the higher the number of beats per minute, the faster the song goes!
